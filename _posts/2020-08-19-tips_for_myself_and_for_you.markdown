* learn "--fail-fast": When going through the Flatiron course, get used to typing this. It's the best way to zero in on the next thing you need to fix.
* end everything: When calling constructs within a method definition, remember to end both. Likewise when there are many things to end. The error messages for missing ends are easy to read but you can save time by remembering to end each thing that needs an end.
* use == when needed: a == b compares a and b, while a = b sets the variable a to equal b. Again, the errors when you get this wrong are usually pretty instructive but you can save time by using the right one the first time.
