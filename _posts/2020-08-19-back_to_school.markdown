I didn't really enjoy school. I enjoyed certain teachers, classes, and classmates, but school itself was not something I missed after I finished my degree. I was nervous about how I would adjust to having coursework but the first few days have shown me I didn't have anything to worry about. Note I'm in the self-paced course - definitely a good choice for me.

In the last few months as social obligations and the need to commute have fallen aside, I found myself with more time on my hands. The default way to pass the time was to watch television and I found myself rewatching series or movies I had already seen (sometimes more than once) because there isn't enough new content to keep me busy.

Friends and family of mine will know that I've always had a thing for domain names. I think at one time I may have had 30 different domains that I was paying to keep registered - and the hope has always been to make something (or many things) useful out of them. I've paid contractors to work on sites, but still don't really have anything public to show for it - I chalk that up to not really knowing what I was doing a decade ago - so finally now I've decided to learn how to do these things myself so I can really create the products I want to create. Instead of just having a vision and user stories, I want to understand how to make my dream sites and how they work. I'm excited to start this Software Engineering journey at Flatiron School and have found it easier than expected to really devote any free time that I have to working on the course. The current pandemic has simplified my life in a way and I think it's the perfect time to make some serious progress toward my goals.

Here are some topics I have found challenging so far or that I want to dig deeper into:
* Installing SSH to work with Github: [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) was the most useful link
* Ruby: calling methods within methods - what is possible and what are the limitations
* Regex: so much to learn here to become fluent, [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/) so far looks like a great resource to spend some time exploring
